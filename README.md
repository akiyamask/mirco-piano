# mirco-piano
code/ 

All the codes I will upload when all parts are finished because something will change soon.

libraries/

we use gesture detection/ light detection/ touched detection 

The thing we finished at this stage is to adjust the volume and frequency of the speaker and in the future we plan to add a microphone to input our voice and a touch sensor to make a piano. Of course, some screens and light will be added if time allowed.

And I have uploaded the demo of the midcheck in the file.
